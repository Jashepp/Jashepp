Web dev, software dev, systems tinkerer, with quite a bit of interest in Docker, Networking, Web Tech (front & back), PC Tech, & various programming languages. I'm almost always experimenting with new ideas in my free time.

I like creating & sharing projects which I think may help others.\
Out of the *many* unfinished hobby projects, some do get enough polish:

**Front-End Web Libraries**:
- [ce-mixinprops](https://github.com/Jashepp/customElements-mixinPropertiesAttributes), a mixin class for HTML Custom Elements (Web Components) to handle/sync properties and attributes.

**NodeJS Libraries**:
- [express-middleware-management](https://github.com/Jashepp/express-middleware-management), a NodeJS module to manage middleware for ExpressJS applications on the fly.
- [eventemitter-wrapper](https://github.com/Jashepp/eventemitter-wrapper), a NodeJS module to wrap an EventEmitter to isolate new listeners from other listeners.

Professionally, I've created and worked on many things over the past 15+ years:
- Custom-Built Websites & Content Management Systems
- Wholesale Portals
- Remote Support Systems
- Intranets & Customer/Job Management Systems
- ISP Systems (automating & creating everything from radius integration, rate-limiting, usage quotas, ip management, automated billing, data management & reporting, websites, email servers, internal systems, router APIs, third-party APIs, monitoring systems, provisioning tools, etc)
- Linux Web Servers & VMs with containers (docker), reverse proxies (nginx/traefik), websites (nginx/apache, php/nodejs, etc), databases (mysql/mariadb), analytics (grafana, prometheus, etc)
