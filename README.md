### Hi,

I'm a full-stack web dev with quite a bit of interest in NodeJS, Javascript and new web technologies. I'm always experimenting with new ideas.

I like sharing projects which I think may help others.

For Example:
- [ce-mixinprops](https://github.com/Jashepp/customElements-mixinPropertiesAttributes), a mixin class for HTML Custom Elements (Web Components) to handle/sync properties and attributes.
- [express-middleware-management](https://github.com/Jashepp/express-middleware-management), a NodeJS module to manage middleware for ExpressJS applications on the fly.
- [eventemitter-wrapper](https://github.com/Jashepp/eventemitter-wrapper), a NodeJS module to wrap an EventEmitter to isolate them from other listeners.
