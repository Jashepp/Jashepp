Web dev, software dev, systems tinkerer, with quite a bit of interest in Docker, Networking, Web Tech (front & back), PC Tech, & various programming languages. I'm almost always experimenting with new ideas.

I like creating & sharing projects which I think may help others.\
Out of the *many* (usually unfinished) hobby projects, some do get enough polish:

**Front-End Web**:
- [scope-dom](https://github.com/Jashepp/Scope-dom), a library to enable declarative HTML logic & behaviour, with hierarchical scoping.
- [ce-mixinprops](https://github.com/Jashepp/customElements-mixinPropertiesAttributes), a mixin class for HTML Custom Elements (Web Components) to handle/sync properties and attributes.

**NodeJS**:
- [express-middleware-management](https://github.com/Jashepp/express-middleware-management), a NodeJS module to manage middleware for ExpressJS applications on the fly.
- [eventemitter-wrapper](https://github.com/Jashepp/eventemitter-wrapper), a NodeJS module to wrap an EventEmitter to isolate new listeners from other listeners.
