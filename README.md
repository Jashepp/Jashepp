Web dev, software dev, systems tinkerer, with quite a bit of interest in Docker, Networking, NodeJS, Javascript and new web technologies. I'm always experimenting with new ideas.

I like creating & sharing projects which I think may help others.

**Web Projects**:
- [ce-mixinprops](https://github.com/Jashepp/customElements-mixinPropertiesAttributes), a mixin class for HTML Custom Elements (Web Components) to handle/sync properties and attributes.

**NodeJS Projects**:
- [express-middleware-management](https://github.com/Jashepp/express-middleware-management), a NodeJS module to manage middleware for ExpressJS applications on the fly.
- [eventemitter-wrapper](https://github.com/Jashepp/eventemitter-wrapper), a NodeJS module to wrap an EventEmitter to isolate new listeners from other listeners.

I have *many* unfinished projects & unpushed commits. Unmedicated Autism+ADHD be like that. Hopefully I'll become more active here soon.
